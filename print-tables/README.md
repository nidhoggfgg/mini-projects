# print-tables

make tables in terminal!

really simple, easy and stupid!

## python

![print-tables](../images/print-tables.png)

NOTE:
It is a demo, there is no error handle code.
use tuple storage char of frame is not a good but simple, so you may need to change it... :)

lots of f-string, because f-string is short for code.
lots of `"".join()`, because attach one string to another will make a new string, spend more time.


## rust

TODO
